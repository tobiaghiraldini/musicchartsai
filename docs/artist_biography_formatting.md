# Artist Biography Formatting Fix

## Issue

Artist biographies from Soundcharts API were displaying with:
- Escaped HTML entities (e.g., `&#39;` for apostrophes)
- Escaped HTML tags (e.g., `&lt;a href=...&gt;` instead of clickable links)
- Poor readability
- No styling for embedded content

## Solution

### 1. Enable HTML Rendering ✅

**File:** `templates/soundcharts/artist_detail.html`

**Changed:**
```django
<!-- Before -->
<p class="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 line-clamp-3">
  {{ artist.biography }}
</p>

<!-- After -->
<div class="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 biography-content">
  {{ artist.biography|safe }}
</div>
```

**What `|safe` does:**
- Marks the string as safe HTML (not escaped)
- Allows HTML tags to render properly
- Converts HTML entities (&#39; → ', &lt; → <, etc.)
- Enables clickable links

### 2. Add Comprehensive Styling ✅

**Added CSS block** in `{% block extrastyle %}`

**Features:**

#### Links Styling
```css
.biography-content a {
    color: #2563EB;              /* Blue color */
    text-decoration: underline;   /* Underlined */
    transition: smooth color change
}

.biography-content a:hover {
    color: #1D4ED8;              /* Darker blue on hover */
}
```

#### Scrollable Content
```css
.biography-content {
    max-height: 200px;           /* Limit height */
    overflow-y: auto;            /* Add scrollbar if needed */
}
```

#### Custom Scrollbar
- Thin 6px scrollbar
- Rounded corners
- Color-coded for light/dark modes
- Hover effects

#### Text Formatting
- **Bold text:** Darker color, font-weight 600
- **Italic text:** Proper italic styling
- **Paragraphs:** Spacing between paragraphs
- **Line height:** 1.6 for readability

#### Dark Mode Support
- Links: Light blue (#60A5FA)
- Scrollbar: Gray tones
- Bold text: White color

## Examples

### Before (Escaped)
```
Billie Eilish remains one of the biggest stars... In 2019, 
her debut album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? 
debuted at No. 1 in 18 countries... &#39;Happier Than Ever&#39; 
debuted at #1 in 20 countries...
```

### After (Rendered)
```
Billie Eilish remains one of the biggest stars... In 2019, 
her debut album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? 
debuted at No. 1 in 18 countries... 'Happier Than Ever' 
debuted at #1 in 20 countries...
```

### With Links (Before)
```
&lt;a href="https://example.com"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;
```

### With Links (After)
```
[Click here](https://example.com)  ← Clickable blue link
```

## CSS Classes Applied

### `.biography-content`
Main container with:
- Line height: 1.6 (improved readability)
- Max height: 200px (prevents excessive height)
- Auto scrolling (if content exceeds height)
- Custom scrollbar styling

### `.biography-content a`
Link styling:
- Blue color (#2563EB in light mode)
- Light blue in dark mode (#60A5FA)
- Underline appears on hover
- Smooth color transitions

### `.biography-content strong/b`
Bold text:
- Font weight: 600
- Darker color for emphasis
- White color in dark mode

### `.biography-content p`
Paragraph spacing:
- Margin bottom: 0.75rem (12px)
- Last paragraph: No margin

## Security Considerations

**Using `|safe` filter:**
- ✅ Safe for data from Soundcharts API (trusted source)
- ✅ Content is from official artist biographies
- ⚠️ Would not be safe for user-generated content
- ✅ Admin-controlled data only

**If concerned about security:**
You can use a template filter to sanitize HTML while keeping safe tags:

```python
# In a custom template filter
from django.utils.html import strip_tags
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe
import bleach

@register.filter(name='safe_biography')
def safe_biography(value):
    # Allow only safe HTML tags
    allowed_tags = ['a', 'p', 'br', 'strong', 'b', 'em', 'i']
    allowed_attrs = {'a': ['href', 'title']}
    
    cleaned = bleach.clean(value, tags=allowed_tags, attributes=allowed_attrs)
    return mark_safe(cleaned)
```

## Testing

### Test Biography Rendering

**Before fix:**
- Apostrophes show as `&#39;`
- Links show as `&lt;a href...&gt;`
- No formatting

**After fix:**
- Apostrophes render correctly: '
- Links are clickable and styled blue
- Proper line spacing
- Scrollbar if content is long

### Test in Browser

1. Go to an artist detail page: `/soundcharts/artists/{uuid}/`
2. Look at the biography section
3. Check for:
   - ✅ Apostrophes render correctly
   - ✅ Links are blue and clickable
   - ✅ Text is readable
   - ✅ Scrollbar appears if biography is long
   - ✅ Links highlight on hover
   - ✅ Dark mode works

## Example: Billie Eilish Biography

**Raw from API:**
```
Billie Eilish remains one of the biggest stars to emerge in the 21st century. 
Her third studio album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT features 10 tracks... 
In 2021, her sophomore album &#39;Happier Than Ever&#39; debuted at #1...
```
