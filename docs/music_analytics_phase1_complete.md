## üîó API Endpoints Used

### SoundCharts Endpoints (Phase 1):

1. **`GET /api/v2/artist/{uuid}/streaming/{platform}`**
   - Returns: Daily Spotify monthly listeners, YouTube views
   - Features: Top 50 cities for Spotify
   - Limit: 90 days per request

2. **`GET /api/v2.37/artist/{uuid}/social/{platform}/followers/`**
   - Returns: Instagram, TikTok, YouTube follower counts
   - Features: Geographic data (monthly)
   - Limit: 90 days per request

**Note**: These endpoints aggregate data at the artist level (not track level).

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Existing Models Used (No new models required!):

1. **`ArtistAudienceTimeSeries`**
   - Stores daily audience values per artist/platform/date
   - Used as primary data source for aggregations

2. **`Artist`**
   - Must have `uuid` field populated (SoundCharts UUID)
   - Artists without UUID cannot be used in analytics

3. **`Platform`**
   - Filtered by `platform_type` ('audience', 'streaming', 'song_chart')

4. **`Chart`**
   - Used to get available countries for filter dropdown

---

- Click to add, can select multiple
- Remove by clicking X on badge

### 3. Configure Search

- Select date range (e.g., September 1-30, 2024)

- Optionally select country (informational)

### 4. View Results

- Click "Analyze Metrics"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations & Notes

### 1. Artist UUID Requirement

**Issue**: Artists from ACRCloud analysis may lack SoundCharts UUIDs

**Solution**: Only artists with UUIDs appear in autocomplete

**User Impact**: Some artists cannot be analyzed until UUID is populated

**Code Comments**: Added in `analytics_service.py` and `analytics_artist_autocomplete()`

### 2. Country Filter (Informational Only)

**Limitation**: Audience data (`ArtistAudienceTimeSeries`) has NO country field

**Reality**: SoundCharts provides global metrics per platform

**What It Shows**: Which country charts we're tracking (context)

**What It Doesn't Do**: Actually filter audience data by country

**Future Enhancement**:
```python
# TODO: Country filtering limitation
# Audience data is platform-wide. SoundCharts provides city-level data
# for Spotify (top 50 cities) stored in api_data JSON field.
# Future: Add 'country' field to model + fetch country-specific data
```

**UI Disclaimer**: 
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: Audience metrics are global per platform. Country filter is for context only.

### 3. Data Availability

**Check Before Results**: System validates data exists for date range

**If Missing**: Returns error with coverage % (requires 90%+ for results)

**Phase 1 Behavior**: User must manually sync data first

**Phase 2 Enhancement**: Auto-trigger background sync tasks

### 4. Date Range Limits

**Maximum**: 365 days per query (enforced)

**SoundCharts Limit**: 90 days per API call

**Implication**: Longer periods require multiple API calls

### 5. Platform Types

**Included**: `platform_type` in ['audience', 'streaming', 'song_chart']

**Reason**: These types have audience data

**Excluded**: Other platform types without metrics

---

## üîê Permissions

**Current**: `@login_required` only (all authenticated users)

**Future TODO**:
```python
# TODO: Add role-based permissions:
# - @permission_required('soundcharts.view_analytics')
# - User roles: admin, analyst, viewer
# - Rate limiting for expensive queries
# - Date range limits by subscription tier
```

## üìù Phase 2: Track-Level Breakdown (TODO)

**Not implemented in Phase 1**, planned for future:

### What It Will Add:

- Track-by-track performance within artist
- Individual song contribution to artist totals
- Track comparison within artist catalog
- More granular analysis

### Implementation Notes:

- Use existing `TrackAudienceTimeSeries` model
- Add "View Track Breakdown" button in results
- Expandable sections per artist
- Shows which tracks contributed to totals

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Edge Cases

### 1. ACRCloud Artists

**Issue**: Artists created via ACRCloud don't have SoundCharts UUID

**Workaround**: Import artist via SoundCharts search first

**Long-term**: Implement artist UUID matching/enrichment

### 2. Data Sync Dependency

**Issue**: Results require pre-synced data in `ArtistAudienceTimeSeries`

**Current**: Manual sync required before analytics

**Phase 2**: Auto-trigger background sync if data missing

### 3. Geographic Data

**Issue**: No country-level audience filtering

**Workaround**: Spotify provides city-level data (top 50 cities)

**Storage**: City data stored in `api_data` JSON field

**Future**: Extract and display top cities in results

---

## üéØ Success Metrics
