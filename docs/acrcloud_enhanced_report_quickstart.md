# ACRCloud Enhanced Report - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
cd /Users/tobia/Code/Projects/Customers/Knowmark/MusicCharts/Django/rocket-django-main

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run Django server
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 2: Access the Application
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000/acrcloud/upload/
```

### Step 3: Upload a Test Song
1. Click "Upload Audio" or navigate to the upload page
2. Select an audio file (MP3, WAV, M4A, etc.)
3. Enter title and artist (optional)
4. Click "Upload"

### Step 4: Wait for Analysis
The song will be processed by ACRCloud. This may take 1-5 minutes depending on:
- File size
- Network speed
- ACRCloud API response time

### Step 5: View Enhanced Report
Once analysis is complete:
1. Click "View Enhanced Report" (blue button)
2. Or navigate directly to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/acrcloud/analysis/<analysis-id>/enhanced/
   ```

## üéØ What to Expect

### If Matches Are Found:
You'll see detailed cards for each match showing:

**Header Section:**
- Track title and artists
- Match type badge (Music/Cover)
- Overall score (large number, color-coded)

**Fingerprint Metrics:**
- Similarity score
- Distance metric
- Pattern matching percentage
- Risk score

**Time Analysis:**
- Match duration in seconds
- Play offset (where match starts)
- Database track time range
- Sample time range

**Distortion Analysis** (if available):
- Time skew (tempo changes)
- Frequency skew (pitch changes)

**Identifiers:**
- ISRC code
- ACRCloud ID
- UPC code (if available)
- Platform links (Spotify, Deezer, YouTube)

### If No Matches Found:
You'll see a message:
> "No Matches Found - This song did not match any tracks in the ACRCloud database."

## üîç Testing Recommendations

### Test Files to Use:

1. **Popular Commercial Track** (Expected: High-confidence matches)
   - Use a well-known song
   - Should return multiple matches with high scores (90-100)
   - Will likely have platform links

2. **Cover Version** (Expected: Cover matches)
   - Upload a cover version of a popular song
   - Should show in "cover_songs" category
   - Lower scores than exact match (50-80)

3. **Modified Track** (Expected: Distortion metrics)
   - Speed up or slow down a track slightly
   - Should show time_skew != 1.0
   - Pitch shift should show frequency_skew != 1.0

4. **Original/Unreleased Track** (Expected: No matches)
   - Use your own original recording
   - Should return no matches
   - Good test for "no results" display

5. **Short Snippet** (Expected: Partial matches)
   - Upload a 30-second clip
   - Check time offsets and played_duration
   - Verify sample range matches clip length

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No Enhanced Report Button"
**Solution:** 
- Check song status is "Analyzed"
- Refresh the song detail page
- Verify analysis completed (check analysis table in admin)

### Issue: "Page Shows No Matches" but there should be
**Solution:**
- Check Analysis.track_matches in Django admin
- Verify webhook processing completed
- Check Analysis.raw_response for match data
- May need to re-run analysis

### Issue: "Missing Fingerprint Values (showing as -)"
**Solution:**
- This is normal - ACRCloud doesn't always provide all fields
- Check raw_data JSONField to verify what was returned
- Optional fields: time_skew, frequency_skew, UPC

### Issue: "No Platform Links"
**Solution:**
- Not all tracks have platform metadata
- Check track_info.external_metadata in raw_data
- Try with a different (more popular) song

### Issue: "Time Offsets All Zero"
**Solution:**
- May indicate match at the beginning of both tracks
- Check if played_duration is also zero (might be data issue)
- Verify in raw_data that ACRCloud provided the values

### Issue: "Page Load Very Slow"
**Solution:**
- If song has 50+ matches, consider pagination
- Check database query performance
- Add select_related/prefetch_related to view
- Consider limiting matches displayed

### Issue: "Colors Look Wrong (Dark Mode)"
**Solution:**
- Check if dark mode classes are applying
- Verify Tailwind CSS dark: variants
- May need to adjust color thresholds

## üéì Training Tips

### For New Users:
1. Start with a known commercial song
2. Compare results with Spotify/Shazam to verify accuracy
3. Upload the same song twice to see consistency
4. Try different audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A)
5. Test with different quality levels (128kbps vs 320kbps)

### For Developers:
1. Check Django admin for raw_data structure
2. Use pattern_matching_report.html for debugging
3. Monitor webhook logs for processing issues
4. Review ACRCloud documentation for field meanings
5. Test with mock_service.py for offline development
