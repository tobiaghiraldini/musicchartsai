## üìã **Understanding the Metrics**

### **Monthly Listeners (Spotify/YouTube)**

**What it is**:
- Unique listeners in a **28-day rolling window**
- NOT total streams/views
- One person = 1 listener (regardless of how many times they listened)

**Example**:
- Date: September 2, 2024
- Value: 107.9M
- **Means**: 107.9M unique people listened between August 5 - September 2 (28 days)

**Why it changes daily**:
- Each day has a new 28-day window
- Old days drop off, new days added
- Creates a "moving average" effect

---

### **Followers (Instagram/TikTok)**

**What it is**:
- Total follower count on that platform
- Cumulative metric (can only grow or decline)
- Snapshot at specific date

**Example**:
- Instagram: 1.8M followers
- **Means**: 1.8M people follow this artist on Instagram

---

## üîß **Technical Improvements**

### **1. Data Type Clarification**

**Yellow info banner** at top:
> "üìä Data Type: These metrics show Monthly Listeners (unique people) for Spotify/YouTube, 
> not total streams/views. Monthly Listeners = unique listeners in a 28-day rolling window."

## üöÄ **What's Missing (Phase 2)**

### **Track-Level Streaming Counts**

**Current limitation**: We show **artist-level monthly listeners** (unique people)

**Phase 2 will add**: **Track-level streaming counts** (total plays/views)

**Why needed**: 
- Monthly listeners doesn't show which songs are popular
- Doesn't show total stream counts per track
- Can't answer "Which song performed best?"

**What Phase 2 will add**:
1. **Track Breakdown Section**:
   ```
   Which tracks contributed to these 8.5M listeners?
   
   Track: AMOR
   - Spotify Streams: 12.5M total plays
   - YouTube Views: 3.2M total views
   
   Track: Rolls Royce
   - Spotify Streams: 8.3M total plays
   - YouTube Views: 2.1M total views
   ```

2. **Different API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/v2/song/{uuid}/streaming-stats` (or similar)
   - Chart data aggregation
   - Track popularity metrics

3. **Combined View**:
   ```
   Artist Level:
   - 8.5M monthly listeners (unique people)
   
   Track Level:
   - 45M total streams across all tracks
   - AMOR: 12.5M streams (top track)
   ```
