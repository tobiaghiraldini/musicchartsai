# Artist-Track Bidirectional Linking - Complete

## Overview

Implemented bidirectional linking between artists and tracks across all dashboard views, ensuring users can navigate seamlessly between artist and track detail pages.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Artist List View - Converted to Table Layout ✅

**File:** `templates/soundcharts/artist_list.html`

**Changed From:** Grid of large cards with images on top  
**Changed To:** Table layout with compact rows

**Table Columns:**
1. **Artist** - Image (circular) + Name + UUID
2. **Country** - Country code
3. **Career Stage** - Color-coded badge
4. **Status** - Metadata fetch status (✓ or ○)
5. **Audience Data** - Platform count or "No data"
6. **Actions** - "View Details" button with eye icon

**Benefits:**
- More compact display
- Shows more information per row
- Better for scanning many artists
- Consistent with other tables in the app
- Easier to see status at a glance

### 2. Track → Artist Links ✅

Added artist links in track views:

#### A. Song Audience Detail Page

**File:** `templates/soundcharts/song_audience_detail.html`

**Changes:**
- **Main Artist Name:** Now links to artist detail page
  ```html
  <a href="{% url 'soundcharts:artist_detail' track.primary_artist.uuid %}">
    {{ track.primary_artist.name }}
  </a>
  ```

- **Related Tracks:** Artist names are clickable
  ```html
  <a href="{% url 'soundcharts:artist_detail' related_track.primary_artist.uuid %}">
    {{ related_track.primary_artist.name }}
  </a>
  ```

#### B. Audience Dashboard (Track Cards)

**Files:**
- `static/assets/audience-charts.js` - JavaScript updated
- `apps/soundcharts/views.py` - TracksWithAudienceView updated
- Webpack bundle rebuilt

**Changes:**
1. **TracksWithAudienceView** - Now includes artist data in API response:
   ```python
   artist_data = {
       'uuid': track.primary_artist.uuid,
       'name': track.primary_artist.name,
       'slug': track.primary_artist.slug,
   }
   ```

2. **JavaScript** - Creates clickable artist links:
   ```javascript
   if (track.artist && track.artist.uuid) {
       artistElement.innerHTML = `<a href="/soundcharts/artists/${track.artist.uuid}/">
           ${track.artist.name}
       </a>`;
   }
   ```

3. **Optimized Query** - Uses `select_related('primary_artist')` for performance

### 3. Artist → Track Links ✅

Already implemented in artist detail page:

**File:** `templates/soundcharts/artist_detail.html`

**Features:**
- Shows up to 10 tracks by the artist
- Track cards with images
- Track names and artist names
- Links to song audience detail pages

## Testing Checklist

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Queries:**

   - `prefetch_related('audience_timeseries__platform')` - Efficient loading
   - Single query for artist data

2. **Frontend:**
   - Webpack bundle minified
   - Lazy loading of charts
   - Efficient DOM updates

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Artists shown in large cards (visual focus on images)
- No quick way to see status information
- Track views didn't link to artists
- Navigation was one-directional

### After
- Artists shown in compact table (information focus)
- Status visible at a glance
- Bidirectional linking (tracks ↔ artists)
- Seamless navigation between related content

## API Response Structure

### TracksWithAudienceView Response (Updated)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tracks": [
    {
      "uuid": "track-uuid",
      "name": "Bad Guy",
      "credit_name": "Billie Eilish",
      "image_url": "https://...",
      "artist": {
        "uuid": "11e81bcc-9c1c-ce38-b96b-a0369fe50396",
        "name": "Billie Eilish",
        "slug": "billie-eilish"
      },
