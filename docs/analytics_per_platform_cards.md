# Music Analytics - Per-Platform Summary Cards

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Cards Now Show Coherent Per-Platform Data

---

## 🐛 **Problem Identified & Fixed**

### **Issue**
When selecting multiple platforms (e.g., Spotify + YouTube), the 6 summary cards showed mixed data:
- **Start Value**: From Spotify's first date
- **End Value**: From YouTube's last date
- ❌ **Incoherent**: Comparing apples to oranges!

### **Solution**
Show **separate card groups for each platform** with color-coded badges

---

## 🎨 **New Layout**

### **Single Platform Selected** (e.g., just Spotify)

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🟢 Spotify     Monthly Listeners           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘

[Start]  [End]  [Diff]  [Avg]  [Peak]  [Days]
 8.2M    9.2M   +1.0M🟢  8.5M   9.5M    30
```

### **Multiple Platforms Selected** (e.g., Spotify + YouTube)

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🟢 Spotify     Monthly Listeners           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘

[Start]  [End]  [Diff]  [Avg]  [Peak]  [Days]
 8.2M    9.2M   +1.0M🟢  8.5M   9.5M    30

┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔴 YouTube     Monthly Listeners           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘

[Start]  [End]  [Diff]  [Avg]  [Peak]  [Days]
 2.0M    2.1M   +100K🟢  2.05M  2.2M    30
```

## 🎨 **Platform Color Coding**

Each platform has its brand color:

| Platform | Badge Color | Card Background |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Spotify** | 🟢 Green | Light green tint |
| **YouTube** | 🔴 Red | Light red tint |
| **Instagram** | 🩷 Pink | Light pink tint |
| **TikTok** | ⚫ Gray | Light gray tint |
| **Facebook** | 🔵 Blue | Light blue tint |
| **Twitter** | 🩵 Cyan | Light cyan tint |

**Visual Hierarchy**:
- Platform badge at top (colored, bold)
- Metric type label (e.g., "Monthly Listeners")
- 6 cards below with matching color theme
- Each card has subtle platform-colored border

---

## 📊 **How It Works**

### **Data Aggregation**

**If multiple artists selected for same platform**:
- **Start**: Sum of all artists' start values
- **End**: Sum of all artists' end values
- **Diff**: Sum of all differences
- **Avg**: Sum of all averages
- **Peak**: Maximum peak across all artists

**Example**: Achille Lauro + Billie Eilish, both on Spotify
- Achille Start: 8.2M, Billie Start: 107.9M
- **Spotify Start Card**: 116.1M (combined)

### **Visual Separation**

Each platform group is visually distinct:
- Platform name badge (colored)
- Metric type label
- 6 cards with platform-themed colors
- Spacing between platform groups

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Single Platform**

**Search**: Billie Eilish, Spotify only, Sept 1-2, 2024

**Expected**:
```
[Spotify Badge] Monthly Listeners

### **Test 2: Two Platforms**

**Search**: Billie Eilish, Spotify + YouTube, Sept 1-2, 2024

**Expected**:
```
[Green Spotify Badge] Monthly Listeners
[6 cards with Spotify data]
  Start: ~107.9M
  End: ~107.9M
  Diff: ±XXK
  Avg: ~107.9M
  
[Red YouTube Badge] Monthly Listeners  
[6 cards with YouTube data]
  Start: ~XXM
  End: ~XXM
  Diff: ±XXK
  Avg: ~XXM
```

### **Test 3: Multiple Artists, Multiple Platforms**

**Search**: Achille Lauro + Billie Eilish, Spotify + YouTube

**Expected**:
```
[Spotify Badge]
[6 cards showing COMBINED Spotify data for both artists]

[YouTube Badge]
[6 cards showing COMBINED YouTube data for both artists]
```
