## HISTORY

### 2025-01-26: Soundcharts Data Flow Consolidation Analysis

#### Background
User needs to consolidate the flow for getting artist music analytics. Current process is manual and requires multiple steps:

1. Fetch chart rankings (to get tracks)
2. Fetch track metadata (to get artists)
3. Fetch artist metadata 
4. Fetch track audience data
5. Fetch artist audience data

This is inefficient and error-prone.

#### Analysis Completed
- Analyzed current architecture and data flow
- Identified gaps in automation
- Proposed automated cascade solution
- Created comprehensive analysis document

#### Current Status
**Done:**
- ✅ Analyzed current codebase
- ✅ Identified all manual steps
- ✅ Documented existing tasks and functions
- ✅ Created analysis document: `docs/soundcharts-consolidation-flow-analysis.md`
- ✅ Implemented automated cascade flow in `tasks.py`
- ✅ Enhanced `fetch_track_metadata` to extract artists/genres and trigger cascade
- ✅ Added missing imports (TrackAudienceTimeSeries, ArtistAudienceTimeSeries)
- ✅ Verified all cascade tasks are properly connected
- ✅ Created implementation documentation: `docs/soundcharts-automated-cascade-implementation.md`
- ✅ Added "Trigger Cascade Data Fetch" button to Chart admin
- ✅ Created API endpoint to trigger cascade for unscheduled charts
- ✅ Added template with AJAX functionality for the button

**Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing:**
- ⏳ Test cascade button with a real chart
- ⏳ Verify data is fetched and linked correctly

#### Key Findings
1. Chart sync creates tracks automatically
2. Track metadata fetch extracts artists and links them
3. But track metadata is NEVER automatically triggered after chart sync
4. Artist metadata and audience data also require manual triggering
5. All the pieces exist, just need to be connected

#### Proposed Solution
Automated cascade flow:
- Chart Sync → Auto-fetch Track Metadata → Auto-extract Artists → Auto-fetch Artist Metadata → Auto-fetch Audience Data

Estimated implementation: 12-15 hours total
Phase 1 (Track Metadata): 2-3 hours
Phase 2 (Artist Metadata): 2-3 hours  
Phase 3 (Audience Data): 3-4 hours
Phase 4 (Optimization): 4-5 hours
