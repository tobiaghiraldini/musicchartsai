# Artist Admin - Form Validation Fix

## Issue

When pressing the "Fetch Metadata from API" or "Fetch Audience Data from API" buttons in the artist change view, Django admin's form validation was being triggered, causing errors about mandatory fields being empty.

## Root Cause

The buttons were using form submission via POST, which triggered Django admin's standard form validation process before our custom handlers could execute. This meant that even though we were trying to bypass validation, Django was validating the form first.

## Solution

### Previous Implementation (Problematic)

The fetch actions were being handled in the `response_change()` method, which runs **after** form validation. This meant:

1. User clicks "Fetch Metadata" or "Fetch Audience"
2. Form is submitted via POST
3. Django admin validates the form ❌ **VALIDATION ERROR HERE**
4. Our handler never gets to run

### New Implementation (Fixed)

The fetch actions are now handled in the `change_view()` method **before** form validation occurs:

```python
def change_view(self, request, object_id, form_url="", extra_context=None):
    """Add custom buttons to the change view and handle fetch actions before form validation"""
    
    # Handle fetch actions BEFORE form validation
    if request.method == "POST":
        if "_fetch_metadata" in request.POST:
            # Get the object without going through form validation
            obj = self.get_object(request, object_id)
            if obj:
                return self._handle_fetch_metadata(request, obj)
        
        elif "_fetch_audience" in request.POST:
            # Get the object without going through form validation
            obj = self.get_object(request, object_id)
            if obj:
                return self._handle_fetch_audience(request, obj)
    
    # ... rest of the method
    return super().change_view(request, object_id, form_url, extra_context)
```

### Flow Now:

1. User clicks "Fetch Metadata" or "Fetch Audience"
2. Form is submitted via POST
3. `change_view()` intercepts the request ✅
4. Identifies the fetch action by checking for `_fetch_metadata` or `_fetch_audience` in POST data
5. Gets the object directly using `self.get_object()` (bypasses form)
6. Calls the appropriate handler method
7. Returns a redirect response
8. **Form validation never runs**

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `change_view()` method
- Added early interception of POST requests
- Checks for `_fetch_metadata` or `_fetch_audience` in request.POST
- Routes to appropriate handler before calling `super().change_view()`

### 2. Created `_handle_fetch_metadata()` helper method
- Extracted metadata fetch logic from `response_change()`
- Gets object directly (no form validation)
- Processes API response
- Returns redirect

### 3. Created `_handle_fetch_audience()` helper method
- Extracted audience fetch logic from `response_change()`
- Gets object directly (no form validation)
- Processes API response
- Returns redirect

### 4. Simplified `response_change()` method
- No longer handles fetch actions
- Just passes through to parent class
- Kept for compatibility with standard Django admin flow

## Benefits

1. **No Form Validation** - Fetch actions completely bypass form validation
2. **Cleaner Code** - Logic is separated into dedicated handler methods
3. **Better Control** - We control the flow before Django admin's form processing
4. **No Model Changes** - We don't need to make fields nullable
5. **Consistent Pattern** - Follows Django admin's recommended pattern for custom actions

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Navigate to an artist in Django admin
2. Leave mandatory fields empty (or don't modify them)
3. Click "Fetch Metadata from API"
4. **Expected:** Metadata is fetched without validation errors ✅
5. Click "Fetch Audience Data from API"
6. **Expected:** Audience data is fetched without validation errors ✅

## Alternative Approach Considered

**Option 1: Make fields nullable**
```python
# NOT RECOMMENDED
name = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
```

**Why rejected:**
- Compromises data integrity
- Fields should be required
- Doesn't solve the real problem
- Would require database migration

**Option 2: Use AJAX (like tracks)**
- Could implement AJAX-based fetch like TrackAdmin
- More complex
- Requires JavaScript changes
- Current solution is simpler and works well
