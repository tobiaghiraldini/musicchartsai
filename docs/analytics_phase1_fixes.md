# Music Analytics Phase 1 - Critical Fixes Applied

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Issues Fixed, Ready for Testing

---

## 🐛 Issues Reported & Fixed

### Issue #1: Placeholder Image 404 Spam ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Template trying to load `/static/dist/images/placeholder-artist.png` which doesn't exist

**Root Cause**: Autocomplete and artist badge rendering were referencing a non-existent placeholder image

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `analytics_search.html` to use artist initials as fallback
- If artist has image → display image with graceful error handling
- If no image OR image fails → display colored circle with first letter of artist name
- No more 404 errors!

**Files Modified**:
- `templates/soundcharts/analytics_search.html`

---

### Issue #2: "Insufficient Data" Error ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: System was checking for PRE-EXISTING data in database instead of FETCHING FRESH data from SoundCharts API

**Critical Misunderstanding**: 
- **What I built initially**: Aggregate existing `ArtistAudienceTimeSeries` records from database
- **What you expected**: Fetch fresh data from NEW SoundCharts endpoints on-demand

**You Were Right**: Phase 1 should fetch data from API, not rely on database!

**Fix Applied**:
- Complete rewrite of `analytics_service.py`
- Added new method: `fetch_and_aggregate_artist_metrics()`
- Calls SoundCharts API endpoints:
  - `/api/v2/artist/{uuid}/streaming/{platform}` for Spotify, YouTube
  - `/api/v2.37/artist/{uuid}/social/{platform}/followers/` for Instagram, TikTok
- Fetches data in 90-day batches (SoundCharts limit)
- Aggregates on-the-fly and returns results
- No database dependency!

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/soundcharts/analytics_service.py` (+270 lines)
- `apps/soundcharts/views.py` (updated to call new method)

## 🔧 What Changed

### New Core Logic Flow:

**Before (WRONG)**:
1. User clicks "Analyze Metrics"
2. Check database for existing `ArtistAudienceTimeSeries` records
3. If data missing → error "insufficient data"
4. If data exists → aggregate and display

**Now (CORRECT)**:
1. User clicks "Analyze Metrics"
2. **Call SoundCharts API** for each artist × platform combination
3. Fetch fresh data from streaming/social endpoints
4. Aggregate fetched data in memory
5. Display results immediately

### API Integration Details:

**Streaming Platforms (Spotify, YouTube)**:
```python
GET /api/v2/artist/{uuid}/streaming/{platform}
Parameters:
  - startDate: YYYY-MM-DD
  - endDate: YYYY-MM-DD (max 90 days from start)

Response: 
{
  "plots": [
    {"date": "2024-09-01", "value": 12500000},
    {"date": "2024-09-02", "value": 12600000},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Social Platforms (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)**:
```python
GET /api/v2.37/artist/{uuid}/social/{platform}/followers/
Parameters:
  - startDate: YYYY-MM-DD
  - endDate: YYYY-MM-DD (max 90 days from start)

Response:
{
  "plots": [
    {"date": "2024-09-01", "value": 1800000},
    {"date": "2024-09-02", "value": 1802000},
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Batch Handling**:
- If date range > 90 days, automatically splits into multiple API calls
- Example: 120-day period = 2 API calls per artist-platform combo

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Restart Django Server
The changes require a server restart to load the updated service:

```bash
cd /Users/tobia/Code/Projects/Customers/Knowmark/MusicCharts/Django/rocket-django-main
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver
```

### 2. Test the Feature

1. **Navigate**: Go to **Soundcharts → Music Analytics**

2. **Search Artist**: 
   - Type an artist name (must have SoundCharts UUID)
   - You should see autocomplete suggestions
   - Select one or more artists
   - **Check**: No 404 errors for placeholder images

3. **Configure Search**:
   - Select platforms (e.g., Spotify, YouTube, Instagram)
   - Set date range (e.g., last 30 days)
   - Optionally select country

4. **Analyze**:
   - Click "Analyze Metrics"
   - **Check logs** for API calls like:
     ```
     INFO Fetching streaming data: https://customer.api.soundcharts.com/api/v2/artist/{uuid}/streaming/spotify
     INFO Fetched 30 streaming data points for {Artist} on Spotify
     ```

5. **View Results**:
   - Should see summary cards with metrics
   - Platform breakdown table
   - Detailed artist × platform breakdown
   - Try Excel export

---

## 📋 Expected Behavior

### Success Case:
- **No 404 errors** in console
- **API calls logged** showing data fetch
- **Results displayed** with aggregated metrics
- **Excel export** works

### Possible Issues:

1. **SoundCharts API Returns 404**:
   - Means artist doesn't have data for that platform
   - System will skip that platform and try others
   - If ALL platforms return 404 → error message

2. **No Artists in Autocomplete**:
   - Means no artists in DB have SoundCharts UUIDs
   - Need to import artists via "Search New Artists" first

3. **API Rate Limiting**:
   - If selecting many artists + platforms over long period
   - Many API calls = potential rate limit
   - Start with 1 artist, 1-2 platforms, 30 days

---

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check API Calls:
Look for these logs in Django console:
```
INFO Fetching streaming data: {url} with params {params}
INFO Fetched {count} streaming data points for {artist} on {platform}
```

### Check for Errors:
```
WARNING No streaming data available for {artist} on {platform}
ERROR HTTP error fetching streaming data: {error}
```

### Verify SoundCharts API:
Make sure `SOUNDCHARTS_API_KEY` and `SOUNDCHARTS_APP_ID` are configured in `.env` or settings

---

## 🎯 Phase 1 vs Phase 2 (Clarified)

### Phase 1 (NOW - Just Fixed):
- ✅ Fetch artist-level data from SoundCharts API
- ✅ Aggregate across platforms and time
- ✅ Display summary metrics
- ✅ Excel export
- ✅ **NO database dependency** (fetch on-demand)

### Phase 2 (Future):
- Track-level breakdown within artist
- Show which tracks contributed to totals
- Use `TrackAudienceTimeSeries` for granular analysis
- Comparison between tracks

## 📝 What's Different Now

**Old Approach** (Database-first):
```
User Search → Check DB → Error if missing → Display if exists
```

**New Approach** (API-first):
```
User Search → Call SoundCharts API → Fetch data → Aggregate → Display
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Always fresh data (real-time from SoundCharts)
- ✅ No need to pre-populate database
- ✅ Works immediately without sync tasks
- ✅ Simpler architecture

**Trade-offs**:
- ⏱️ Slower response (API calls take time)
- 🔄 More API quota usage
- 💾 Data not persisted (fetched each time)

**Future Enhancement** (Optional):
- Cache results for repeated queries
- Store fetched data in `ArtistAudienceTimeSeries` for historical analysis
- Hybrid approach: check cache → fetch if missing

---

## ✅ Ready to Test!

Both issues should now be resolved:
1. ✅ No more 404 placeholder image spam
2. ✅ Fresh data fetched from SoundCharts API

**Please test and let me know**:
- Does autocomplete work without 404s?
- Does "Analyze Metrics" button fetch and display data?
- What does the Django console log show?
- Any error messages?

If you still see issues, check Django logs for the specific API errors and we'll debug further!
