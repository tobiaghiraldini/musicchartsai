The documentation of this project is stored in the /docs folder, each topic per file, in .md format.
Strings between <> in this rule are name placeholders, to be replaced with actual names in the rule execution.
When appropriate, keep track of the details of the design and the implementation in specific documents files.
For example: When building the integration with an external service, keep track of the logic, details, configurations, mock data location and so on, in a dedicated md file, named along the integration service name, and appended the main topic, like "soundchart_integration".
When setting up the project, or when implementing some features that requires additional dependencies or configuration, track the details in a <feature_name>\_setup.md file. if it's generic or part of the project setup use the setup.md file.
When configuring the project for deployment, keep track of the details, configurations, variations needed for the deployment phase in the deploy.md file. if it's a specific part that needs a configuration, use a <part_name>\_deploy.md file.
